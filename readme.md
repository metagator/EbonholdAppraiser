Ebenhold Appraiser for WotLK 3.3.5a (Project Ebenhold).

Ebenhold Appraiser tracks Vendor Value so you can see what your loot is worth at a glance. It keeps a running session total and lets you set a simple goal. It’s built to work alongside Greedy Scavenger on Ebenhold. The window is movable, lockable, and includes a theme toggle.
